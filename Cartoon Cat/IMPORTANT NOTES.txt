Credit the mod when using the chromatics!

Chromatic notes:
for normal and toon CC you might wanna add a bit of vibrato to his voice, so it doesnt sound too robotic

for Toon BF: add a bit of porta to his voice to get it more accurate

Toon bf is also missing 2 samples which are not used that much in the song, one is an "uuu" and the other one is the "Bee" you can hear a couple of times
